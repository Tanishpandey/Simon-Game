# Simon Game

**Simon Game** is a digital implementation of the classic memory-based electronic game, designed to challenge players' memory and reaction skills. The game involves a series of colored buttons that light up in a random pattern. The player must repeat the pattern in the correct order, with each round adding an additional color to the sequence. The game provides audiovisual cues for an engaging experience and progresses in difficulty as the player advances through levels.

## Key Features

- **Memory Challenge**: The game generates a random pattern of colors, and the player must replicate it to advance.
- **Audiovisual Cues**: The game includes sound effects and visual cues (color flashing) to enhance engagement.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is fully responsive, ensuring smooth gameplay across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Level Progression**: As the player successfully replicates patterns, the gameâ€™s difficulty increases by adding more colors to the sequence.
- **User Input**: Players interact with the game by clicking on color buttons to repeat the sequence.

## How the Game Works

1. **Pattern Generation**: The game generates a random sequence of colors at the start of each round.
2. **Player's Response**: The player must click on the colored buttons in the correct order.
3. **Level Progression**: After successfully replicating the pattern, the player advances to the next level, where the pattern length increases.
4. **Game Over**: If the player selects an incorrect color or fails to follow the pattern, the game ends, and the player is given the option to start over.
